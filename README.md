#Readme

This is the readme file for Project 1, Group 4 composed of the following team members.

1) Katherine Young  
2) Imen Najar
3) Mosa Hasen
4) Abdullah Jaura

The data for this project was sourced from https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/ using the 2011_12 merged data set. The original file is too large to upload to GitHub but consolidated versions were used for analysis. 

This Repo Contains 3 main folders for our Code Files, Images extracted from coding for the presentation, and Resources which includes the consolidated data files. 

These folders were reorganized after all project work was done. Some of the file paths in the coding files may not work because of this reorganization, but worked during the process of analysis. 

We primarily used individual files to extract and analyze the data. This way, we would not need to wait on others to complete data pulls and chart creation. This is why there are multiple code files in the code folder. 
We shared code when it was helpful for the group, such as if everyone needed so sort or group the data in a certain way. 

Our code files and images contain additional pulls, charts and analysis that ultimately did not make it into the final presentation. Rather than delete the work, we kept it as is.

The git ignore file contains some lines for larger files or api keys that needed to be ignored in uploading to github.

The Repo also contains our final presentation file (Project 1 - Group 4) and a scope document that was used to guide, ideate and plan our project and analysis. 

The presentation file (Project 1 - Group 4) contains write up of our scope, sample information, analysis and data visuals and conclusion.
